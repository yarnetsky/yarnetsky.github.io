## Service to the Libraries

### ***Strategic Initiatives Professional Development working group (AY 2020-21)***

Our working group collaboratively created and analyzed results from a survey that explored staff needs for professional development documentation. We made a series of recommendations for this guide that emphasized editorial representation from all parts of the library to help keep the guide current and sustainable.
