        <p>Whenever the opportunity provides, I present on the work our team conducts. share best practices </p>
        <p>Like many other academic libraries across the United States, we have eliminated our in-person reference service point. When this change occurred, we did see an increase in chat transactions but the overall number of patron  interactions decreased. In an attempt to increase our engagement with library patrons, the libraries’ web  development team collaborated with subject librarians to implement a proactive chat system. Like with many similar  systems that are employed on commercial websites, patrons are invited to ask a question if they remain on a single  page of the libraries’ website for more than 45 seconds. The first part of this presentation will discuss the  rationale behind the decision to move to a proactive chat system as well as specific information on how the system  was developed and deployed. The second half will present information on the effect of the service, covering not only  simple data points such as the number of total interactions and the average time of engagement per patron, but also  changes in the quality and nature of the questions. This will be accomplished by using the text-analysis tool Voyant  to analyze the chat transcripts from before and after the implementation of the proactive chat system. <a href="https://www.alaoweb.org/resources/conferences/2019/archive/Session%202/Proactive%20Chat.pptx">Presentation Slides</a> (Powerpoint file)</p>
        <p>Library websites have long been run by database-driven content management systems (CMSs) such as Drupal and WordPress. Unfortunately, the digital vulnerabilities of such systems are significant and require frequent maintenance to maintain security. Static-site generators (SSGs), such as Jekyll and Gatsby, take a different approach by entirely removing slow and risky databases from the live site. The results are sites that are fast and more secure and that can be easier to host and easier to archive for the future. Yarnetsky covers how the SSG development model differs from the current CMS model, how SSGs can work for you and your community, how to make these geeky tools user-friendly, and finally pulls back the curtain on how our university libraries have utilized static site generators as the core of our online services.</p>

        <p>Overview: During our extensive accessibility remediation, I've corrected many errors that repeat on nearly every page  because they were embedded into the website’s templates. However, I also found there were still a substantial number of errors in the content feeding into these templates. This made me curious if other university libraries were having similar content accessibility issues?</p>
        <p>Methodology: I focused on LibGuides, a common content creation platform for academic libraries. I used our university’s automated accessibility testing platform to evaluate 1000 pages from each of the Big 10 Conference university libraries. From the results, I focused on two common, but easy to correct types of accessibility issues— having alternative text available for all images and creating links with meaningful text (as opposed to "click here").</p>
        <p>Findings: I found that half the university libraries had significant content issues (more than 15 percent of all pages with errors) in one or both of these categories. Interestingly, Minnesota's 36% error rate was actually worse than Indiana at 97% because Indiana's errors resulted from a single university logo without alt text that would be easy to correct. Minnesota's errors were in the content of multiple librarian-created research guides.</p>
        <p>Making our online content universally accessible to our entire academic community is integral to our professional ethics. In this endeavor, our web developers/librarians can maintain perfect, accessible templates for our websites and LibGuides. However, if the content flowing into these pages have accessibility errors, then we can still ruin our students' educational experience. This is what could be described as our last mile challenge on accessibility. In training guides and sessions, we often teach creators <em>how</em> to make content accessible, but rarely explain why the methods work. As a result, the difficult concepts remained a mystery. Through (trial and error) trainings and presentations, it was discovered that explaining how our students use assistive technologies and how our content inadvertently posed barriers to these tools that our content creators gained an understanding for why these best practices worked. Equally important we gained an empathy for our students.This session will cover these topics and how we can use simple browser-based tools to visualize how students using assistive technologies see our content. Finally, <a href="https://www.liba11y.org/">an online accessibility guide</a> that can be taken back to our libraries will be shared. Earlier in the year, I made a TechConnect presentation at ACRL. This was the original presentation where I introduced the LibA11y resource.</p>

      <p>  Overview: In Ohio, public school funding models have been ruled unconstitutional four times due to the great discrepancies among districts from different economic and geographic areas. One of these discrepancies is often the availability of librarians and library services. In our research, we aimed to examine how these discrepancies may alter preparedness for college-level research for incoming first-year students from various backgrounds. </p>
<p>Methodology: We worked with the Office of Institutional Research to compile a list of students from Appalachian-designated counties. We narrowed this list to Ohio counties that were considered at risk economically. We then sent a survey to these students and to a control group of students from other Ohio counties from our incoming first-year class. We received 117 responses in total. </p>
<p>Findings: We asked students about their high school library experiences and their confidence to do university library research. We found that students from poorer Appalachian counties were more likely to receive information literacy and research skills in high school from someone other than a librarian. These same students also reported being less confident in their ability to do university-level library research.</p>
<p>My contributions: I co-authoring the survey. After the survey's completion I took the lead in analyzing the results. I co-authored our presentations.</p>
<p>Results Sharing: Abi and I presented our team's findings as a virtual poster session at the Academic Libraries Association of Ohio 2020 Conference. We have also submitted a poster for the Association of College & Research Libraries' 2021 Conference.</p>
<p>2021 Update: We plan to reconduct our study to see how the emergency remote learning in high school influenced student research readiness upon admission to our university. Our original 2019 study results can act as a control group to highlight possible differences.</p>
<p>In October 2021, social sciences librarian Abi Morgan and I conducted an IRB-approved survey of incoming first-year students to gauge their perceptions of their readiness to do college-level research. I co-authored the survey and am currently leading the analysis of the results as we probe how regional poverty and variables such as high school instruction influences this readiness. This is a follow-up to our 2019 research project below.</p>
    <p><strong>MORE INFO</strong> We shared our research where we examined how these school funding discrepancies may have altered preparedness for college-level research for incoming first-year students from various backgrounds. We found significant differences in student confidence between students taught by librarians in high school and students taught by others. I co-wrote the poster presentation and edited our introductory video.</p>
