        OneCampus Project: In December 2021, I was trained on the new system slated to replace the MyMiami portal in 2022. Using an iPad-like interface of icons you click to quickly reach your destination, you can search or browse sets of tasks and destinations. The libraries were chosen as a pioneering partner in the system and I was designated as the content leader. I collaborated with Nick Kneer to select our top tasks for the system.
Training for Freedom documentary website: This documentary is now being distributed by PBS. To prepare the supporting website for greater traffic, I conducted an accessibility remediation and implemented design updates to make the site mobile friendly.
Freedom Summer Traveling Exhibit reservation system and website: Special Collections and Archives is creating a new Freedom Summer traveling exhibit. I am collaborating with that team, Meng Qu, and student employee/luminary Rill Howard to create a reservation system and website to support this project.
Havighurst Archives and Special Collections website design updates: Created and coded design updates for ContentDM, their digital collections repository, and WordPress, which hosts their departmental website. Work included content strategy consultation, web design, and template programming. This assistance enabled digital collections librarian Alia Wegner to modernize access to their service for mobile devices and provided a more pleasing and cohesive interface for the digital collections.
King Libraries Master Plan mini-site: Designed and coded a single-page site to showcase the King Library Master Plan. The site provides the university community and potential funders what we hope a thriving 21st century library will look like here at Miami University. The page features beautiful “parallax” paging to walk people through the building plans. Collaborated with our strategic communications team on this project.
