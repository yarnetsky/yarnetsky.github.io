### My favorite contribution

My experience designing online library services included seven years at a community college. Frequently working the reference desk, I found our incoming students had little understanding of library terminology or knowledge of what libraries could do to support their education. To bridge that gap, I designed our library online services specifically with simplicity and clarity in mind.

For example, I found that grouping the library's many services and resources into just three larger buckets on our website that that new students were able much more quickly to find their needed resources. More importantly, everyone else loved the results. The faculty and returning students loved the speed at which they were able to get to what they needed. 

That experience was the genesis of our website's three-menu system. Happily, in our usability tests, this simplified menu approach proved its ability to lead students to what they were looking for and that a site's first huge hurdle.

That's my favorite contribution to our libraries website. I love its clarity and that it just works. In my four years here at Miami, I've continued to strive for this level of clarity for our web services. Though it's fair to say clarity is a process — I'm always seeing a dozen places to test to see if further clarity can be attained.

### [A-Z Database Listing](https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/az.php) (pictured)

For years our 500+ databases were only accessibly by title. I moved our A-Z Database listing its Drupal home to LibGuides which enabled for its robust interface featuring faceting by academic subject, database type, and searching by title and description. Worked with librarians to customize the interface and apply subject taxonomy to our database listing. This later provided core data to the MyGuide project created by web services librarian Ken Irwin.

### Proactive Chat Service

![proactive chat box screenshot](/assets/img/proactive-chat.png#right) With chat traffic stagnating, I worked with a team of librarians to improve our libraries’ chat reference service. We decided to implement a proactive service where students are invited to chat automatically if they spend more than 45 seconds on the same page. I programmed this service into the templates of our website and LibGuides including an option for librarians to choose whether they want proactive chat included on their individual research guides. The change more than doubled our chat traffic to 3,473 chats in 2018-19. Collaborated with librarians Katie Gibson, Matt Benzing and Laura Birkenhauer on the project. I also co-presented with librarian Andrew Revelle on proactive chat at the 2019 ALAO annual conference.

![Makerspace reservation system screenshot](/assets/img/reservations.png#featured) 

The Covid-19 pandemic posed a slew of challenges for providing equitable library services. How would in-person services translate online? How do we allow researchers and makers to make full use of the libraries while keeping everyone safe? We needed to quickly plan and implement several new and upgraded virtual services. For each of these projects I collaborated with staff to best understand their needs. I then focused not solely on the needed functionality, but on how our students and staff would interact with the functionality to eliminate as much friction as possible. Here are examples of the various projects required to keep our system running during Covid.

### [Appointment systems for Special Collections and University Archives](https://muohio.libcal.com/reserve/equipment/makerspace)

Because researchers are working with rare materials and nearly always need librarian/archivist assistance, I integrated a custom reservation form with conditional fields that allowed new researchers to seamlessly fill out the archives user agreement and for the researcher's needs to be captured during the reservation process. This way the librarian/archivist is prepared when the researcher arrives. Collaborated with Alia Wegner and Tiffany Dogan. 

### [Curbside pickup](https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/use/borrow/curbside/)

We've long providedspace reservations for our study rooms, we just moved that space outside to our parking lot behind King Library. We implemented curbside pickup as an extension to patrons placing holds on items. When these holds are ready for pickup, they then make an timed appointment for the parking space where a library employee then brings out their selections.

### Statistics Help Desk and Zoom integrations

The undergraduate-oriented Stats Help Desk was originally hosted in-person at BEST Library. Because the tutor works with students on highly detailed, visual, and technical topics, moving to this service to text-based chat would not suffice. To bridge this gap, I integrated video conferencing software into our online chat service so the tutors could seamlessly segue from text chat to video conversations and screen sharing for demonstrations. We also needed the ability to share complex equations and graphs so I installed the MathJax javascript library to translate LaTeX equation shorthand into presentable, accessible equations. I also recorded tutorial videos and provided instruction for desk student employees on use of the chat service and on advanced topics such as accessibility for complicated math graphs. (This service is currently in hiatus).

**Zoom in Ask-a-Librarian**: At the same time, I also activated the Zoom teleconferencing software in our chat reference system and appointment software so all librarians could utilize video chat in their reference exchanges and one-on-one appointments. 

### Art Museum ticketing system  

Like everyone else, when the Miami University Art Museum reopened it was by appointment only. I worked with the museum director and marketing coordinator to create a LibCal-based ticketing system similar to those used in large museums for limited engagement gallery shows. As a result, the museum was able to easily control their capacities. I was also able to customize the ticket sign-up so they were also able to collect as they needed to know demographics and class-oriented data to go with the reservations.

### [OneCampus Project](http://miamioh.onecampus.com/)

myMiami will be retiring in 2022. I was trained on this new upcoming system as the project lead for the libraries, which is one of the very first partners on the new system. OneCampus is super simple in that it **only** provides sets of task tiles you can search or browse through to quickly reach your destination. It will be fascinating to see how this new system changes how the libraries acquire university online traffic. 

### [Training for Freedom documentary website](https://trainingforfreedom.lib.miamioh.edu)

[![Training for Freedom screenshot](/assets/img/train4freedom.png#interior)](https://trainingforfreedom.lib.miamioh.edu)

In late 2021, we learned this locally-produced documentary will be distributed nationally by PBS. To prepare the supporting website, created by university archivist Jackie Johnson, for greater traffic, I conducted an accessibility remediation and implemented code updates to make the site mobile friendly. I also provided design assistance in the site's creation phase in 2019.

### [New website staff page](https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/about/organization/staff/)

In collaboration with systems staff Mike Bomholt and Pat Hawk, we automated maintenance of this page as well as chunks of employee onboarding. When a new employee is hired, their supervisor submits a form with their basic information which populates a Google Sheet. I programmed the webpage to automatically pull this data through templates to create the page. I then programmed the filtering capabilities to make finding staff easier.

### King Libraries Master Plan mini-site

One of my fun design projects was a single-page website to showcase the King Library Master Plan. The site provides the university community and potential funders what we hope a thriving 21st century library will look like here at Miami University. The page features beautiful “parallax” paging to walk people through the building plans. Collaborated with our strategic communications team on this project.

### [Proxy bookmarklet](https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/MULGStandards/proxy-bookmarklet)

When using third-party academic search engines, such as Google Scholar, often encounter needed content blocked by paywalls. To solve this issue, I wrote a Javascript bookmarklet that can be clicked to gain access when encountering a paywall. If the libraries subscribe to the article's journal, the reader is sent through our ID verification proxy server and automatically given access to the article.
