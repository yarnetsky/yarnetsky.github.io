After beta testing in early 2020, our team released our new libraries website in summer 2000. Contributed more than 50,000 lines of code and editing to the project. During spring we conducted usability testing to identify areas needing remediation prior to full release. I co-wrote the IRB-approved testing regime, analyzed results of live and recorded tests, wrote the initial set of recommendations, and collaborated with the team to craft solutions.

Our web services team of Ken Irwin, Meng Qu, and I collaborated to release our beta version in early 2020. From there we spent the spring semester debugging, fixing accessibility issues, and usability testing. We released our new site for primary use in summer 2020. I contributed more than 50,000 lines of code to the project via our Git-based collaboration system.

**Usability testing and remediation**: We conducted IRB-approved usability tests with the goal of finding usability and findability issues needing remediation before its general releasing. We also collaborated with Emerging Technology in Design and Business students on eye-track testing of our new site. In addition to in-person usability, we also solicited and received many comments from our website feedback form.
Challenges: The pandemic forced us to move our testing to tele-conferencing and screen sharing. This switch was actually beneficial as it was difficult to simultaneously run the test and take detailed notes in our live sessions. The recorded sessions allowed us to repeat interactions and pinpoint issues. 

Example finding/remediation: Multiple testers were unable to find the location of our third-floor King Library Makerspace so we redesigned the page (and our other service points pages) to include a highly visible box dedicated to just location and contact information. 
Contributions: I edited and rewrote portions of our IRB application. Analyzed live and recorded usability tests. From my analysis, I wrote an initial set of recommendations our team collaboratively debated and crafted solutions.
Continuous accessibility: Our team worked with Laura Fathauer of AccessMU to ensure our site remains fully accessible as we designed and developed our site. For example, re-coding our navigation to ensure proper keyboard control and working with third-party vendors to remediate embedded content such as event calendars from Localist.

University Libraries website remediation: When the web services team joined the libraries in 2018, we found the website had aged poorly over the last decade. It needed significant accessibility remediation and suffered from extensive code overlaps and lack of a cohesive design. Librarian Melissa Cherry and I fixed critical accessibility issues in multiple library systems. I repaired our primary website while Melissa did extensive work upgrading our room booking system. We also dramatically improved our services' performance on mobile devices, simplified the publishing workflow for our strategic communications team, and enhanced site security and patron privacy by encrypting our site traffic. I also developed a system where guests could access our online catalog and results from our Ebscohost databases.

Publishing tools for strategic communications team: For the first major revision to our new libraries website, I created a set of tools that allow our library strategic communications team to publish directly to our website and have detailed control over news and promotional aspects of the site. New tools also provide an editorial workflow with content review and publication staging. I configured the Netlify content management system and Jekyll static site generator for the project and reprogrammed our website page templates to pull content from this new system. Collaborated with Meng Qu on design and Pat Hawk on server configuration.

The Covid-19 pandemic posed a slew of challenges for providing equitable library services. How would in-person services translate online? How do we allow researchers and makers to use the libraries while keeping everyone safe? We needed to quickly plan and implement several new and upgraded virtual services. For each of these projects I collaborated with staff to best understand their needs. I then focused not solely on the needed functionality, but on how our students and staff would interact with the functionality to eliminate as much friction as possible.

**Curbside pickup**: In the same way we created reservations for study rooms, we also created reservations for a parking slot in the King Library parking lot. Patrons place items they need on hold. When these holds are ready for pickup, they make an timed appointment for the parking spot where a library employee then brings out their selections. Collaborated with Kris Abney and Rob Withers.

**Appointment systems for Special Collections and University Archives**: Due to limited seating in the archives, the Havighurst had to move to reservations only. Because researchers are working with rare materials and nearly always need librarian/archivist assistance, I integrated a custom reservation form with conditional fields that allowed new researchers to seamlessly fill out the archives user agreement and for the researcher's needs to be captured during the reservation process. This way the librarian/archivist is prepared when the researcher arrives. Collaborated with Alia Wegner and Tiffany Dogan. 

**Appointment systems for Create and Innovate Makerspace**: In 2020, we extended their existing makerspace reservation system to make the makerspace workshop available by appointment only. I also recorded training videos for student staff to learn the system. I collaborated with C+I staff Sarah Nagle and Lori Chapin on this project.

**Statistics Help Desk**: This undergraduate, social sciences-oriented help desk was originally hosted in-person at BEST Library. Because the tutor works with students on highly detailed, visual, and technical topics, moving to this service to text-based chat would not suffice. To bridge this gap, I integrated video conferencing software into our online chat service so the tutors could seamlessly segue from text chat to video conversations and screen sharing for demonstrations. We also needed the ability to share complex equations and graphs so I installed the MathJax javascript library to translate LaTeX equation shorthand into presentable, accessible equations. I also recorded tutorial videos and provided instruction for desk student employees on use of the chat service and on advanced topics such as accessibility for complicated math graphs. Collaborated with librarian Anna Liss Jacobsen on this project.

**Zoom integrations**: Activated Zoom tele-conferencing software in our chat reference system so all librarians could utilize video chat in their reference exchanges as they deemed necessary. Also integrated Zoom for one-on-one librarian appointments. To simplify the appointment process, I integrated the Zoom appointment links into the appointment confirmation emails and our Google Calendars.
Updated study room availability: Implemented reduced capacity and periodic closures so room cleaning could take place. Collaborated with Samantha Brandenburg.

**Art Museum ticketing system**: Due to pandemic limitations, when the art museum reopened for fall semester, viewings could be by appointment only. I worked with the museum director and marketing coordinator to customize LibCal and create a ticketing system similar to those used in large museums for limited engagement gallery shows. As a result, the museum can now easily control their capacities. This project included a lot of customization as they needed to know demographics and class-oriented data to go with the reservations.

**Proactive Chat Service implementation**: With chat traffic stagnating, I worked with a team of librarians to improve our libraries’ chat reference service. We decided to implement a proactive service where students are invited to chat automatically if they spend more than 45 seconds on the same page. I programmed this service into the templates of our website and LibGuides including an option for librarians to choose whether they want proactive chat included on their individual research guides. The change more than doubled our chat traffic to 3,473 chats in 2018-19. Collaborated with librarians Katie Gibson, Matt Benzing and Laura Birkenhauer on the project. I also co-presented with librarian Andrew Revelle on proactive chat at the 2019 ALAO annual conference. 

**OneCampus Project**: In December 2021, I was trained on the new system slated to replace the MyMiami portal in 2022. Using an iPad-like interface of icons you click to quickly reach your destination, you can search or browse sets of tasks and destinations. The libraries were chosen as a pioneering partner in the system and I was designated as the content leader. I collaborated with Nick Kneer to select our top tasks for the system.

**Training for Freedom documentary website**: This documentary is now being distributed by PBS. To prepare the supporting website for greater traffic, I conducted an accessibility remediation and implemented design updates to make the site mobile friendly.

**Freedom Summer Traveling Exhibit reservation system and website**: Special Collections and Archives is creating a new Freedom Summer traveling exhibit. I am collaborating with that team, Meng Qu, and student employee/luminary Rill Howard to create a reservation system and website to support this project.
    
**Havighurst Archives and Special Collections website design updates**: Created and coded design updates for ContentDM, their digital collections repository, and WordPress, which hosts their departmental website. Work included content strategy consultation, web design, and template programming. This assistance enabled digital collections librarian Alia Wegner to modernize access to their service for mobile devices and provided a more pleasing and cohesive interface for the digital collections.

**King Libraries Master Plan mini-site**: Designed and coded a single-page site to showcase the King Library Master Plan. The site provides the university community and potential funders what we hope a thriving 21st century library will look like here at Miami University. The page features beautiful “parallax” paging to walk people through the building plans. Collaborated with our strategic communications team on this project.

Proxy bookmarklet: When using third-party academic search engines, such as Google Scholar, often encounter needed content blocked by paywalls. To solve this issue, I wrote a Javascript bookmarklet that can be clicked to gain access when encountering a paywall. If the libraries subscribe to the article's journal, the reader is sent through our ID verification proxy server and automatically given access to the article.

New digital collections landing page: Developed new landing page leveraging the wonderful images found within our digital collections. The new page not only promotes the collections to students and researchers, but also visually conveys the care we give to our collections to prospective donors.

New website staff page automation: Created our new libraries staff page which features the ability to filter staff by department, liaison duties, and building. I collaborated with systems staff Mike Bomholt and Pat Hawk to automate maintenance of this page, which starts with a form submitted by the supervisor.

Guest access to search results: Configured system where guests could access results from our online catalog and from our Ebscohost databases. Sign-in through our proxy server is still required to access subscription-only materials.

Credo Instruct mini-site: Upgraded this mini-site which provides Miami faculty with links to more than 80 information literacy training modules created by Credo Reference. I did javascript coding and editing work to make it easier for faculty to grab the links required to embed these modules into their Canvas course sites. Collaborated on this project with staff from all three campus libraries.
