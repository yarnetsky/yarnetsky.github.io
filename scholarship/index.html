        <p>In Ohio, public school funding models have been ruled unconstitutional four times due to the great discrepancies among districts from different economic and geographic areas. One of these discrepancies is often the availability of librarians and library services. When I heard librarian Abi Morgan was doing research that delved into this topic I jumped to join in because Pennsylvania, where I had worked as a community college librarian, also had one of the worst school funding models in the nation. Having personally worked with students coming from the richest and poorest school districts in the state, I saw this diachotomy first hand. In our research, we aimed to examine how these discrepancies may alter preparedness for college-level research for incoming first-year students from various backgrounds.</p>

        <p><strong>Methodology</strong>: On our first round of research, we worked with the Office of Institutional Research to compile a list of students from Appalachian-designated counties. We narrowed this list to Ohio counties that were considered at risk economically. We then sent a survey to these students and to a control group of students from other Ohio counties from our incoming first-year class. We received 117 responses in total.</p>

        <p><strong>Findings</strong>: We asked students about their high school library experiences and their confidence to do universitylibrary research. We found that students from poorer Appalachian counties were more likely to receiveinformation literacy and research skills in high school from someone other than a librarian. These samestudents also reported being less confident in their ability to do university-level library research.</p>

        <p>I co-authoring the survey. After the survey’s completion I took the lead in analyzing theresults. I co-authored our presentations.</p>

        <p>Results Sharing: Abi and I presented our team’s findings as a virtual poster session at the AcademicLibraries Association of Ohio 2020 Conference. We have also submitted a poster for the Association of College&amp; Research Libraries’ 2021 Conference.</p>

        <h3 id="update">2021 Update</h3>

        <p>In October 2021, social sciences librarian Abi Morgan and I conducted an updated version of this research with this year’s incoming class. This time, we based our evaluation of poverty on the Ohio Department of Education’s <a href="https://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Data/Frequently-Requested-Data/Typology-of-Ohio-School-Districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Typology of Ohio School Districts</a>, which divides Ohio’s 650+ public school districts by their rural-urban-suburban and poverty characteristics. We also asked questions about remote learning in this survey. Librarians from Ohio State University-Newark also participated between our surveys we have more than 200 respondants. In spring 2022, we will be analyzing our results and endeavor to publish and present on our findings.</p>

        <p>Sharing best practices is at the core of our profession’s work and a number of specialized technology inlibraries/higher education conferences exist for this very purpose — including Computers in Libraries,Code4Lib, and WebCon. I present and volunteer at these conference when at all possible to learn the latestbest practices. Here are two topics I’ve recently presented on…</p>

        <p><strong>Static site generators</strong>: Library websites have long been run by database-driven contentmanagement systems (CMSs) such as Drupal and WordPress. Unfortunately, the digital vulnerabilities of suchsystems are significant and require frequent maintenance to maintain security. Static-site generators (SSGs),such as Jekyll and Gatsby, take a different approach by entirely removing slow and risky databases from thelive site. The results are sites that are fast and more secure and that can be easier to host and easier toarchive for the future. At my presentations, the first where I invited my colleagues to join me, I covered howthe SSG development model differs from the current CMS model, how SSGs can work the library community, how tomake these geeky tools user-friendly, and how we use SSGs here at Miami.</p>

        <p><strong>Proactive chat</strong>: Like many other academic libraries across the United States, weeliminated our in-person reference service point. In an attempt to increase our engagement with students andthe university community, I collaborated with subject librarians to implement a proactive chat system. Similar to systems employed by commercial sites, patrons are invited by a slide-out to ask a question if they remain on a single page of the libraries’ website for more than 45 seconds. I co-presented with librarianAndy Revelle on this topic. In the first part of this presentation, I talked about the rationale behind thedecision to move to a proactive chat system as well as specific information on how the system was developedand deployed. In the second half, Revelle presented information on the effect of the service. One of hisinteresting findings was that our chats dramatically increased, but the types of questions stayed the samepercentage-wise. <a href="https://www.alaoweb.org/resources/conferences/2019/archive/Session%202/Proactive%20Chat.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Presentation  Slides</a> (Powerpoint file)</p>

        <p>Web accessibility is technically challenging, but very satisfying because making our online content universally accessible to our entire academic community is integral to our professional ethics.</p>

        <p>During our extensive accessibility remediation, I’ve corrected many errors that repeat on nearly every page because they were embedded into the website’s templates. However, I also found there were still a substantial number of errors in the content feeding into these templates. This made me curious if other university libraries were having similar content accessibility issues?</p>

        <p><strong>Methodology</strong>: I focused on LibGuides, a common content creation platform for academic libraries. I used our university’s automated accessibility testing platform to evaluate 1000 pages from each of the Big 10 Conference university libraries. From the results, I focused on two common, but easy to correct types of accessibility issues— having alternative text available for all images and creating links with meaningful text (as opposed to “click here”).</p>

        <p><strong>Findings</strong>: I found that half the university libraries had significant content issues (more than 15 percent of all pages with errors) in one or both of these categories. Interestingly, Minnesota’s 36% error rate was actually worse than Indiana at 97% because Indiana’s errors resulted from a single university logo without alt text that would be easy to correct. Minnesota’s errors were in the content of multiple librarian-created research guides.</p>

        <p>Using this study as a starting point, I presented about content accessibilty for librarians at the national ACRL and state ALAO library conferences. In addition, I created an open educational resource on accessibility. The first version was for librarians. Liba11y.org was created as a resource people could take home from my presentation to their staff as ways to improve their LibGuide content. A second version, which I’m currently editing, is for students taking web development courses. I’ve been piloting its use in my IMS222 class starting in Fall 2021.</p>

        <h3 id="liba11y-update">2021 LibA11y Update</h3>

        <p>According to site analytics, use of this site nearly doubled in 2021. More than 825 users from 45 states and 52 nations have read more than 1,900 pages on the site since its creation in spring 2019.</p>
